		// Q: What is call back? Can you explain it?
		// A: Callback is the way of Javascript's functions
		//		executed. The functions in Javascript can be
		//		passed as an argument within another function
		//		and then return the value to the higher function.
		//		Another word, the function that does not have
		//		any function as a parameter will be executed
		//		first because it does not have to wait for
		//		other functions to be return their result.


		// Example
		// Below is a callback functions, where the parameter
		//	of myHomework that was passed won't execute until
		//	the object of the callback function is returned.
		//	In this case, console log from myHomeworkCallback's
		//	parameter is not executed until it has received
		//	the callback value from the function itself.
		//	Note that one of the callback will be execute because
		//	of how my if else statement works. With the nature of
		//	if-else statement, one function will be called only
		//	one time in this example, thus, 1 out of 3 callback (or
		//	callbackError) will be executed. Even though callbackError
		//	was passed to myHomeworkCallback parameter, but it did not
		//	execute because it did not get a response from the function
		//	calling itself.

		let homeworkLeft = 0;
		// let homeworkLeft = 1;
		// let homeworkLeft = -2;

		// Function expression for the callback function
		let myHomeworkCallback = (callback, callbackError, homework) => {
			if(homework == 0){
				callback('playing game');
			} else if (homework > 0){
				callback('doing homework')
			} else {
				callbackError('Amount of homework can\'t be negative!')
			}
		}

		// Begin calling callback function
		myHomeworkCallback((cb) => {console.log('I will be ' + cb)},
					(err) => {console.log('Error! ' + err)},
					homeworkLeft)
